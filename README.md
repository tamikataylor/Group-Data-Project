# Group Data Project 

# Mushroom Toxcity

# Motivation
We decided to do our group project on mushroom toxicity. The reason being that some of us are avid cooks that enjoy cooking with different varieties of mushrooms and embrace the idea of being able to forage for them ourselves. Especially since they grow abundantly here in the PNW. To see if there were any correlations between a mushroom's toxicity and its characteristics, we looked at Heat Maps, Logistical Regression, and Cross Tabulation Maps. 

# Data
To obtain our data we used Kaggle. The data did not require any cleaning just some manipulation within the Juypter notebooks. The mushroom notebook contained 22 different characteristics. However, we decided to focus on three of them being: Odor, Spore Print Color, and the Cap Color. First, we looked at Heat Maps to determine the first impressions of the data and what had the highest correlations. Next, we attempted the Logistical Regression, however, due to the high number of variances in the characteristics typical logistical regression did not work. Instead, we looked at the cross-tabulation maps using the logistical regression to get a better visual between the character types and the edibility of the mushrooms.
