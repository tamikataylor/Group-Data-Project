# Group Data Project 

# Mushroom Toxcity

# Motivation
We decided to do our group project on mushroom toxcity. The reason being because some of us are avid cooks that enjoy cooking with different varieties of mushrooms and embrace the idea of being able to forage for them ourselves. Especially since, they grow abundantly here in the PNW. In order to see if there were any correlations between a mushrooms toxcity and its charateristics, we looked at Logistic Regression, Heat Maps and Correlations Maps. 

# Data
We found our raw data using Kaggle. However, everything was entered using an assigned letter per feature. In order to have our maps work properly, we used the count features to be able to view the different characteristics on our Heat and Correlation Maps. The raw data on Kaggle, also included 22 different characteristics ranging from physical to habitat and population. In order to narrow our data we chose three characteristics to look at, they were: 
We first looked at the Logistica Regression to first determine how many mushrooms in our data were either edible or poisonous.
