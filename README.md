# Mushroom Toxcity

# Motivation
We decided to do our group project on mushroom toxcity. The reason being because some of us are avid cooks that enjoy cooking with different varieties of mushrooms and embrace the idea of being able to forage for them ourselves. Especially since, they grow abundantly here in the PNW. In order to see if there were any correlations between a mushrooms toxcity and its charateristics, we looked at Heat Maps and Cross Tabulation Maps.
